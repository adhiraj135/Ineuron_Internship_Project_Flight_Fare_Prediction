## **Approach**

Data Exploration : I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn.

Data visualization : Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables.

Feature Engineering : All The Value Are Arrange In One Range.

Model Selection I : Tested all base models to check the base accuracy.

Model Selection II : Performed Hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchCV.

Pickle File : Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file using Pickle .

## **Webpage & deployment :**

Created a web form that takes all the necessary inputs from user and shows output.
Deploy
